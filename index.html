        <div class='title'>Hello, worldðŸŒŽ, Iâ€™m Tyler!<br>

        <div class="paragraphs">
            <p class='body'>Ever since a young age, Iâ€™ve been interested in technology and design. Through being the
                firstgeneration to grow up with the internet to building countless wood projects and creative spaces,
                <span class="bold">purposeful</span> design has been important to me. Ultimately, this fascination with creativity and design has
                led me to find web development the perfect landscape to extend my passion towards building interactive 
                and intuitive web experiences.
            </p>
            <p class="body">Along with development, I am very active in the developer community online and in local
                Chicago
                meetups. I,
                amongst others, build up and motivate other like minded individuals, document our progress and learn the
                latest
                technologies with developers globally! Currently, I am studying Web Development and Design at College of
                Dupage
                and plan on continuing my education at Columbia College.</p>
